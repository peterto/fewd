**Web Design Best Practices**

*Know your target audience*

Windows to keep open:
swatches, layers, history, chracters
workspaces can be created for different "profiles"

Smart object:
>> can group layers into smart objects that separate out layers into a different "file"

**Tools:**

Marque: selects a specific area in a layer, can confine your changes to that selected area
Move: Moves a selected area
Lasso: Freeform marque
	Opt + click = subtract
	Shift + click = add
Magic Wand: Lets you select an area that's similar, will not be exact. Adjusting tolerance will adjust how much the wand picks.
Crop: Cropping canvas.
Eye Dropper: Color picker
Brush tool: For use with brushes
	> blurry
	ctrl + click = brush properties
Pencil: Similar to brush, but good for pixel accuracy
Paint Bucket: Inside is the grandient tool
Pen: It's vectorized, meaning, it's a line, to modify use the path tool. Use the direct selection tool to actually manipulate the box.


Use web colors if you're doing web design work.
Actions can be saved as a droplet for easier automation.

Color Profiles: Most monitors are scaled for sRGB

For logos you probably want it vectorized and work in Illustrator.

Creating new documents:

When creating buttons, you want the preferences for image interpolation set to nearest neighbor, which saves it with all the hard edges.

For photos you want it set to bicubic.
Make sure the Pixel Grid is set to on.
You want to design in a grid.
